# TrendBytes
Bringing Social Media to You

### Think.. 
There are a lot of times when you might have wished, that the amazing local bakery shop down the street, magically start selling your favorite strawberry cheesecake. 

If you are that bakery owner, you might have come across times where you felt that people are not buying what you are selling. 

### The Challenge



### So where does TrendBytes come in? 



It is an app that aims to help local shop owners make day to day business decisions keeping in line with the community demands. 





# InsightDataScience

This project was made during the Insight Data Science (Toronto) program, within 4 weeks. 

* Week 1 was brainstorming projects that solve a business problem. 

* Week 2 was about implementing the most basic solution and presenting a Minimal Viable Product. 

* Week 3 involved more focus on adding validation to the machine learning models used and making a live app hosted online, and presenting a Minimal Viable Demo. 

* Week 4 was about polishing that demo and improving the business pitch with recognition of pitfalls and applicability of the product.
